I've seen a few discussions like "Where's my Image file when I publish my dashboard?" or similar.  It might be related to someone having put the image in a Favorites folder in the BO Platform or forgetting to migrate it up in whatever folder it's in, or likewise in the SE80 MIME Repo on the NetWeaver side.
